# Keras Alexnet: Dog vs. Cat Classification
***Insert Alexnet Model Here***

I want to build a simple Deep Learning model for image classification on [Kaggle Dog vs. Cat Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats). In this project, I decided to use Alexnet architecture as it repeatedly mention during my Machine Learning course. This project is simple enough that helps me understand Alexnet, familiarize with Keras, and gain more experience in ML field.

## Dataset

After download and extract dataset from zip file, let's view the data.
